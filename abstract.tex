\section*{Abstract}
We study the security of lattice based crypto system based on ideal lattices and principal ideal lattices. for the latter, there exists a quantum polynomial attack. For systems which use ideal lattices and has a basis for the lattice as public key, we show that they are somewhat insecure.
